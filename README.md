Here is all you can do in the application:
- create new packages
- create new facts
- modify existing facts
- modify existing packages
- delete existing facts
- delete existing packages (this will delete all the facts inside the package before deleting the package)
- answer the questions of the facts in a given package
- rate how well you answered each question (at the end of the learning session, you will get a review telling how well you performed)

And everytime you do something, there are always verifications. For example, if you want to create a new fact, you can't leave an empty question or answer. I let you try everything by yourself.

Now, here are all the screens of the application:
